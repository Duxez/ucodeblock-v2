# UCodeblock v2

> The new and improved version of UCodeblock!  
Now with 20% better code, 50% less bugs and 100% more blocks!

This plugin aims at bringing a **runtime** visual scripting editor to the Unity game engine, to allow users/players to script behaviours at runtime. An exemplary usecase could be an educational, programming-based game. The goal is to make the plugin similar to existing projects in other languages and environments, such as Google Blockly.

The requirements for this goal are pretty complex, documentation is attempted inside the [wiki](https://github.com/YilianSource/ucodeblock-v2/wiki).
